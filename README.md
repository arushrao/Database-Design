# Database-Design

Problem Statement:

TTI has agreed to sell new equipment to the company at the end of 3 years at no cost as long as they agree to enter into a new 3-year lease agreement. TTi has rented a warehouse to hold its inventory and entered into contracts with several manufacturers in China and Taiwan to obtain high quality parts at a reasonable price. It has also hired salespeople and doubled its repair work force to meet the anticipated increase in business. TTi has realized that it can no longer use Excel spreadsheets to meet their data and information needs. It is looking to use open source and has decided to develop an application using Python and MySQL. Your team has been brought in to design a database that can meet all of its data needs. Create a report that contains the following: 

1. Data requirements of TTi: What are the critical data requirements based on your understanding of TTI business scenario described above. 
2. Key Entities and their relationships 
3. A conceptual data model in MySQL 
4. Key Assumptions made while preparing the data model
